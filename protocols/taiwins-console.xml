  <interface name="taiwins_console" version="1">
    <description summary="the console interface of taiwins">
      This interface acts as a shell to submit multiple commands to the
      server. It is also the port to do fork-exec.

      It has a difficult structure, the procedure complex, 1. When keybinding
      actived, server indicates the client to start the commander. 2. The client
      then needs to create the surface and request an UI element in order to
      draw on it. 3. Then after the commit, the UI appears and works like other
      application. 4. The client can choose to close the destroy the surface and
      the ui element and do nothing. 5. If it needs submit information to the
      server. It can do that now. 6. Then If server needs it to exec an
      application. It will pass the `exec` command to the client.

      The first 3 event/request works like TCP/IP, clients waits for ACK to do
      the next. But once started. It can perform quickly.

	This is the only time that compositor updates its knowledge
	about configuration buffer to avoid the racing, you may still have
	problem when one application launches from launcher, the other starts
	somewhere else.
