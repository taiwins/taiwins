    <description summary="factory for creating dmabuf-based wl_buffers">
      Following the interfaces from:
      https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/EXT/EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import.txt
      https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/extensions/EXT/EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import_modifiers.txt
      and the Linux DRM sub-system's AddFb2 ioctl.

      This interface offers ways to create generic dmabuf-based
      wl_buffers. Immediately after a client binds to this interface,
      the set of supported formats and format modifiers is sent with
      'format' and 'modifier' events.

      Clients can use the get_surface_hints request to get dmabuf hints for a
      particular surface. If the client wants to retrieve hints not tied to a
      surface, they can use the get_default_hints request.

      The following are required from clients:

      - Clients must ensure that either all data in the dma-buf is
        coherent for all subsequent read access or that coherency is
        correctly handled by the underlying kernel-side dma-buf
        implementation.

      - Don't make any more attachments after sending the buffer to the
        compositor. Making more attachments later increases the risk of
        the compositor not being able to use (re-import) an existing
        dmabuf-based wl_buffer.

      The underlying graphics stack must ensure the following:

      - The dmabuf file descriptors relayed to the server will stay valid
        for the whole lifetime of the wl_buffer. This means the server may
        at any time use those fds to import the dmabuf into any kernel
        sub-system that might accept it.

      However, when the underlying graphics stack fails to deliver the
      promise, because of e.g. a device hot-unplug which raises internal
      errors, after the wl_buffer has been successfully created the
      compositor must not raise protocol errors to the client when dmabuf
      import later fails.

      To create a wl_buffer from one or more dmabufs, a client creates a
      zwp_linux_dmabuf_params_v1 object with a zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1.create_params
      request. All planes required by the intended format are added with
      the 'add' request. Finally, a 'create' or 'create_immed' request is
      issued, which has the following outcome depending on the import success.

      The 'create' request,
      - on success, triggers a 'created' event which provides the final
        wl_buffer to the client.
      - on failure, triggers a 'failed' event to convey that the server
        cannot use the dmabufs received from the client.

      For the 'create_immed' request,
      - on success, the server immediately imports the added dmabufs to
        create a wl_buffer. No event is sent from the server in this case.
      - on failure, the server can choose to either:
        - terminate the client by raising a fatal error.
        - mark the wl_buffer as failed, and send a 'failed' event to the
          client. If the client uses a failed wl_buffer as an argument to any
          request, the behaviour is compositor implementation-defined.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

        It indicates that the server can support the format with an implicit
        modifier. When a plane has DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID as its modifier, it
        is as if no explicit modifier is specified. The effective modifier
        will be derived from the dmabuf.

        A compositor that sends valid modifiers and DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID for
        a given format supports both explicit modifiers and implicit modifiers.

        The 64-bit unsigned value combined from modifier_hi and modifier_lo
        is the dmabuf layout modifier. DRM AddFB2 ioctl calls this the

        This asks for creation of a wl_buffer from the added dmabuf
        buffers. The wl_buffer is not created immediately but returned via
        the 'created' event if the dmabuf sharing succeeds. The sharing
        may fail at runtime for reasons a client cannot predict, in
        which case the 'failed' event is triggered.

        The 'format' argument is a DRM_FORMAT code, as defined by the
        libdrm's drm_fourcc.h. The Linux kernel's DRM sub-system is the
        authoritative source on how the format codes should work.

        The 'flags' is a bitfield of the flags defined in enum "flags".
        'y_invert' means the that the image needs to be y-flipped.

        Flag 'interlaced' means that the frame in the buffer is not
        progressive as usual, but interlaced. An interlaced buffer as
        supported here must always contain both top and bottom fields.
        The top field always begins on the first pixel row. The temporal
        ordering between the two fields is top field first, unless
        'bottom_first' is specified. It is undefined whether 'bottom_first'
        is ignored if 'interlaced' is not set.

        This protocol does not convey any information about field rate,
        duration, or timing, other than the relative ordering between the
        two fields in one buffer. A compositor may have to estimate the
        intended field rate from the incoming buffer rate. It is undefined
        whether the time of receiving wl_surface.commit with a new buffer
        attached, applying the wl_surface state, wl_surface.frame callback
        trigger, presentation, or any other point in the compositor cycle
        is used to measure the frame or field times. There is no support
        for detecting missed or late frames/fields/buffers either, and
        there is no support whatsoever for cooperating with interlaced
        compositor output.

        The composited image quality resulting from the use of interlaced
        buffers is explicitly undefined. A compositor may use elaborate
        hardware features or software to deinterlace and create progressive
        output frames from a sequence of interlaced input buffers, or it
        may produce substandard image quality. However, compositors that
        cannot guarantee reasonable image quality in all cases are recommended
        to just reject all interlaced buffers.

        Any argument errors, including non-positive width or height,
        mismatch between the number of planes and the format, bad
        format, bad offset or stride, may be indicated by fatal protocol
        errors: INCOMPLETE, INVALID_FORMAT, INVALID_DIMENSIONS,
        OUT_OF_BOUNDS.

        Dmabuf import errors in the server that are not obvious client
        bugs are returned via the 'failed' event as non-fatal. This
        allows attempting dmabuf sharing and falling back in the client
        if it fails.

        This request can be sent only once in the object's lifetime, after
        which the only legal request is destroy. This object should be
        destroyed after issuing a 'create' request. Attempting to use this
        object after issuing 'create' raises ALREADY_USED protocol error.

        It is not mandatory to issue 'create'. If a client wants to
        cancel the buffer creation, it can just destroy this object.

        added dmabufs.

        In case of import success, no event is sent from the server, and the
        wl_buffer is ready to be used by the client.

        Upon import failure, either of the following may happen, as seen fit
        by the implementation:
        - the client is terminated with one of the following fatal protocol
          errors:
          - INCOMPLETE, INVALID_FORMAT, INVALID_DIMENSIONS, OUT_OF_BOUNDS,
            in case of argument errors such as mismatch between the number

            height, or bad offset or stride.
          - INVALID_WL_BUFFER, in case the cause for failure is unknown or
            plaform specific.
        - the server creates an invalid wl_buffer, marks it as failed and
          sends a 'failed' event to the client. The result of using this
          invalid wl_buffer as an argument in any request by the client is
          defined by the compositor implementation.

        This takes the same arguments as a 'create' request, and obeys the

      These hints are sent once when this object is created and whenever they

      Compositors can re-send the hints when the current client buffer
      allocations are sub-optimal. Compositors should not re-send the hints if
      re-allocating the buffers would not result in a more optimal
      configuration. In particular, compositors should avoid sending the exact
      same hints multiple times in a row.

      The tranche_target_device and tranche_modifier events are groupped by
      tranches of preference. For each tranche, a tranche_target_device, one
      tranche_flags and one or more tranche_modifier events are sent, followed

        it accessible from the target device, ideally directly. The buffer must
        still be accessible from the main device, or else the compositor
        might make the wl_buffer creation fail (see the
        wp_linux_buffer_params.create and create_immed requests for details).

        If the device is a DRM node, the DRM node type (primary vs. render) is
        unspecified. Clients must not rely on the compositor sending a
        particular node type. Clients cannot check two devices for equality by
        comparing the dev_t value.

        This event is tied to a preference tranche, see the tranche_done event.

    <event name="tranche_modifier">
      <description summary="preferred buffer format modifier">
        This event advertises the formats that the server prefers, along with
        the modifiers preferred for each format. The preferred formats and
        modifiers must have been advertised as supported formats by the
        wp_linux_dmabuf interface.

        For legacy support, DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID (that is, modifier_hi ==
        0x00ffffff and modifier_lo == 0xffffffff) is allowed in this event.
        It indicates that the server can support the format with an implicit
        modifier. When a plane has DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID as its modifier, it
        is as if no explicit modifier is specified. The effective modifier
        will be derived from the dmabuf.

        A compositor that sends valid modifiers and DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID for
        a given format supports both explicit modifiers and implicit modifiers.

        Compositors must not send duplicate format/modifier pairs within the
        same tranche or across two different tranches with the same target
        device.

        This event is tied to a preference tranche, see the tranche_done event.

        For the definition of the format and modifier codes, see the
        wp_linux_buffer_params.create request.

        The scanout flag is a hint that direct scan-out may be attempted by the
        compositor on the target device if the client appropriately allocates a
        buffer. How to allocate a buffer that can be scanned out on the target
        device is implementation-defined.
